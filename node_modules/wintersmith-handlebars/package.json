  "readme": "## Handlebars plugin for Wintersmith\nThis plugin provides support for using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) for [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io).\n\nThis plugin was inspired from [wintersmith-hogan](https://github.com/sfrdmn/wintersmith-hogan).\n\n### How to use\nEither\n\n1. Download the repo and copy the `wintersmith-handlebars.coffee` file into your `plugins` directory of your `wintersmith` install.\n2. Remember to add `wintersmith-handlebars.coffee` to your `config.json` file as well.\n3. Starting writing handlebars templates in your templates directory as `.html` files\n\nOr\n\n1. Install it as a node module via `npm install wintersmith-handlebars`\n2. Follow steps 2 and 3 above.\n\n#### Partials\nThis plugin provides support for [partials in handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/#partials).\n\nTo start using it, just add a `partials` directory in your template folder and add partial template files in there.\n\nYou can also rename this file to any other fancy name you would like. For eg, if you want it to be `bits`, you can simply define that in your `config.json` as follows:\n\n```json\n\"handlebars\": {\n  \"partialDir\": \"bits\"\n}\n```\n#### Helpers\nYou can add helpers for Handlebars by adding functions in the helper directory. By default, this direcotry is named `helpers`, and is placed under `templates`. You can specify custom name for this folder in `config.json`:\n```json\n\"handlebars\": {\n  \"helperDir\": \"helpers\"\n}\n```\n\nEach helper is its own file. The filename will be registered as the helper name.\n\nAn example of a helper function:\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(stuff) {\n  console.log(stuff);\n    return;\n}\n```\nSee `examples` folder for more information.\n\n#### Note\nTo use the `locals` variables in the template, instead of writing `{{locals.name}}` like in the jade template, simply just write `{{name}}`. This applies for other variables as well.\n\nSee the wiki for a [sample 'locals' context](https://github.com/tnguyen14/wintersmith-handlebars/wiki/Sample-locals-variables) being passed to the compiled handlebars template to see what's available and how to call them.\n\n### Under development\nThis plugin is my first attempt at bringing support for handlebars to wintersmith. It is still very new, experimental and under development (read: there might be bugs).\n\nIf for some reason it doesn't work for me, please submit an issue and I will hopefully fix it.\n\n#### Smith away!",
